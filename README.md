# Email-List

This is a simple program that provides the user with a simple interface with which they can manipulate a list of email subscribers.

For the most part the user controls the program by inputting different numbers to select which part of the program they would like to use. The other main thing that the user should input is actual email addresses. There a few instances when the user should input an actual word but the program will prompt the user when it is necessary to do so.

The program will gives the user the ability to add emails to the list of subscribers, remove emails from the list of subscribers, and view the entire list of subscribers.

It's important to note that the program will not save the emails that the user entered after closing the program. This program is merely a concept required by my intro to programming class.
